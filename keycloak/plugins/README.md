# Keycloak Plugins

Custom Java plugins for Keycloak:
- [Trust Email](src/main/java/trust_email/README.md)
- [Account Update](src/main/java/account_update/README.md)

Documentation on how to create Keycloak plugins can be found in the 
[Keycloak SPIs][1]

## Build

Ensure you have the Maven build command `mvn` installed. An IDE such as Intellij
may provide this for you automatically

Run the following command:
```shell
mvn install
```

The output JAR can be found in the generated `target` directory

## Install

To use these plugins, copy the output JAR into the `opt/keycloak/providers` directory
of your Keycloak installation

If using a docker file, it is recommended to download the JAR directly from the
latest release of this repository from GitHub within a multistage build like so:
```dockerfile
FROM alpine AS neon-plugins

RUN wget https://github.com/neondatabase/keycloak-plugins/releases/download/<VERSION>/neon-plugins.jar

...

COPY --from=neon-plugins /neon-plugins.jar /opt/keycloak/providers/
```
replacing the `<VERSION>` as appropriate 

## Release

Updated versions of these plugins should be shared via GitHub Releases

Github Action will automatically trigger and build a new version of the plugin upon Release.
